# Deep-Learning-Based-Image-Classification
This repository presents a comprehensive implementation and comparison of several models for image classification using both deep learning and traditional machine learning approaches. The goal is to examine how different architectures and kernels perform in terms of accuracy, generalization, and computational cost.
